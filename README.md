# NLP-Autocorrect

We use autocorrect every day on your cell phone and computer. The model is not identical to the one we in our phone, but it is still quite good.

## Contents
1. Get a word count given a corpus
2. Get a word probability in the corpus
3. Manipulate strings
4. Filter strings
5. Implement Minimum edit distance to compare strings and to help find the optimal path for the edits.
6. Dynamic programming 

Similar systems are used everywhere.

For example, if you type in the word "I am lerningg", chances are very high that you meant to write "learning".
